# Quantum-portfolio-optimization
This project combines Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for portfolio optimization using real financial time series. The goal is to generate plausible synthetic returns using QGANs and perform quantum-enhanced risk minimization using VQE, comparing outcomes with classical optimization (cvxpy).
